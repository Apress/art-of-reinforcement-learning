    """Gym environment for board game Go.

    The main logic and rules are implemented in the go_engine.py module, which is copied from

    Goole's Minigo project:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/minigo


    Please note that the go_engine.py module implements a simplified version of the Tromp-Taylor scoring system,
    which is based on the rules described in the Tromp-Taylor Rules (https://senseis.xmp.net/?TrompTaylorRules) or a similar variation of those rules.

    The Tromp-Taylor rules states that both players are required to capture the stones they believe to be dead before passing.
    Failure to capture these stones will result in them being scored as if they were alive.
    Additionally, empty regions bordering stones of both colors are considered nobody's territory, just like they would be in a seki situation.

    However, it's important to be aware that this implementation cannot handle dead stones before counting the areas.
    Because accurately detecting dead stones at the end of a game is a complex task that often requires the use of additional techniques
    such as use simulation to play more moves, or use neural networks to prediction the score.
    Consequently, there is a possibility of incorrect scores for certain games.
